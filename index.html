                        women migrant workers, especially those in distress. Other agencies (e.g.
                        the Department of Labor and Employment and the Department of Social
                        Welfare and Development) are also mandated to cooperate in strengthening

                        laws and policies to effectively stop discrimination against Filipino women.
